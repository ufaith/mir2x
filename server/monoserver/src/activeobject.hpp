 *    Description: server object with active state
 *                      1. it's active via actor pod
 *                      2. it's stateful
 *
 *                 actually stateless object can be implemented as a static object
 *                 after activated this kind of object can only be modified via messages
 *
 *                 This prevent me implement MonoServer as react object. For MonoServer
 *                 it needs to manager SessionHub. However SessionHub is not an actor, so
 *                 if MonoServer is an react object, we have to launch SessionHub before
 *                 calling of MonoServer::Activate(), but, before activation of MonoServer
 *                 we don't have the address of Mo MonoServer to pass to SessionHub!
 *
 *                 In my design, SessionHub create Session's with SID and pass it to the
 *                 MonoServer, then MonoServer check info of this connection from DB and
 *                 create player object, bind Session pointer to the player and send the
 *                 player to proper RegionMonitor via ServerMap object.
 *
 *                 Another thing is for g_MonoServer->AddLog(...), if make MonoServer as
 *                 a react object, we can't use it anymore
 *
 *                 access control protocol for ActiveObject
 *                 for active object A and B, A can access B through b->func() iif
 *                    1. B outlives A
 *                    2. B::func() is constant qualified
 *                 otherwise any time if A need to access B, should use GetUIDRecord() and
 *                 forward a message to B for response
