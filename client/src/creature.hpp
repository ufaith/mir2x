 *    Description: should I use factory method to create all creatures? seems I have to
 *                 allow to create creatures with current motion as MOTION_NONE
 *
 *                 reason:
 *                      class Creature is supposed to be base of many derived
 *                      classes, then if define its constructor as
 *
 *                          Creature(nUID, pRun, stAction)
 *
 *                      means every time if we wanna create it, we should provide
 *                      currently its motion, however, think about class Monster
 *                      public derived from Creature:
 *
 *                          Monster(nUID, nMonsterID, pRun, stAction)
 *
 *                      this class is for general monsters, then it only allow
 *
 *                          MOTION_STAND
 *                          MOTION_WALK
 *                          MOTION_ATTACK
 *                          MOTION_UNDERATTACK
 *                          MOTION_DIE
 *
 *                      means other action -> motion would fail.
 *
 *                      now, if we further derive MonsterD from Monster, MonsterD
 *                      is a specified monster which can't walk. then in the ctor:
 *
 *                          MonsterD(nUID, pRun, stAction)
 *                              : Monster(nUID, pRun, stAction) // <-- fail
 *                          {...}
 *
 *                      then here we call Monster() and it fails
 *
 *                      My object is to find a method to ensure that if a creature
 *                      is created by new, then it's already in valid state.
 *
 *                      this helps to simplify the logic, everytime if we have new
 *                      input, we always are sure current it's valid, and if the
 *                      input is valid, then it keeps valid after the operation.
 *
 *                      so we should define a valid motion to *all* creatures, then
 *                      when constructed it's automatically in that motion state.
 *
 *                      so I use MOTION_NONE
 *
 *                      factory method works as a two phases solution:
 *
 *                          Monster *Create(nUID, pRun, stAction)
 *                          {
 *                              p = new Monster(nUID, pRun);
 *                              p->PrivateParseNewAction(stAction);
 *
 *                              return p;
 *                          }
 *
 *                      then when get p, it's already in valid stAction. but this
 *                      need to define PrivateParseNewAction(), which can handle
 *                      creature in invalid state.
 *
 *                      PrivateParseNewAction() first check if current state valid? if
 *                      not, make it valid and then call the public ParseNewAction()
 *
 *                      but at the beginning how we to make it valid?? We have to make
 *                      one explicitly, which means we have to define a motion valid
 *                      for *all* creatures. MOTION_STAND? no, some creatures may not
 *                      stand even. actually this is the hard step.
 *
 *                      then immediately I will use MOTION_NONE
 *                      but if MOTION_NONE is valid, we can just use
 *
 *                          auto p = new Monster(nUID, pRun);
 *                          p->ParseNewAction(stAction);
 *
 *                      we don't even need the factory method any more. the cost is for
 *                      all function of Monster, we have to take care of MOTION_NONE,
 *                      this is a nightmare, every place I have to check for MOTION_NONE
 *                      
 *                      to get rid of this noise, currently how work around
 *                          Monster *Create(nUID, pRun, stAction)
 *                          {
 *                              1. p = new Monster(nUID, pRun);
 *                              2. p->MakeMotion(MOTION_STAND, stAction.X, stAciton.Y)
 *                              3. p->ParseNewAction(stAction)
 *
 *                              return p;
 *                          }
 *
 *                       
 *                      this method will make up a motion based on stAction, nasty hack
 *                      but this can give use the assume:
 *
 *                          1. all creatures are made by Create(nUID, ...)
 *                          2. once made, it's guarenteed to be in valid state
 *
 *                      then only constructor can leave creature with MOTION_NONE, but
 *                      we make it protected, and make interface as Monster::Create()
